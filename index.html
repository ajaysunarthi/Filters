            <h4 id="heading">Some of the instagram filters.Based on canvas blending modes and filter property. All these filters can be achieved with far more control and accuracy using CSS as done by CSSgram. But CSS only put layers above the images. So, you cannot save the images to the desktop.
            To check this feature I have plotted those filters using javascript. 
            You can now save the image as well. Feel free to fork. Use images with equal aspect ratio.
